# IoT Vulnerability Analysis: Unpatched Medical Devices

## a. What is the vulnerability?
Many medical devices, such as insulin pumps and pacemakers, are shipped with outdated software that lacks critical security patches.

## b. Who might exploit it? Explain.
Cybercriminals or malicious actors might exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to medical devices, potentially causing harm to patients or stealing sensitive health data.

## c. Why does the vulnerability exist?
The vulnerability exists because medical device manufacturers often prioritize functionality over security and may not provide regular updates for their devices.

## d. What could be done to limit the vulnerability?
To limit this vulnerability, manufacturers should implement regular security updates, perform thorough security testing before deployment, and ensure that devices have secure communication channels.
